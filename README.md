## Hi Stranger ðŸ‘‹

<a href="https://blogs.ams.org/phdplus/2015/04/28/coffee-into-theorems/">I am a machine for turning coffee into theorems.</a> â˜•

My name is Daeun, a rising junior at Princeton studying Applied Math and Engineering. I spend most of my time at <a href="https://www.dailyprincetonian.com/article/2022/11/tea-fine-hall-math-professor-students"> Fine Hall</a> where I share a cup of coffee with the greatest minds of the world discussing very useless, yet beautiful things. I enjoy doing research that might lead some to ask, "when am I ever going to use this?"
