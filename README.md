## ðŸ’Œ Dear Stranger,

<a href="https://blogs.ams.org/phdplus/2015/04/28/coffee-into-theorems/">I am a machine for turning coffee into theorems.</a> â˜•

My name is Daeun, a rising junior at Princeton studying Applied Math and Engineering. I spend most of my time at <a href="https://www.dailyprincetonian.com/article/2022/11/tea-fine-hall-math-professor-students"> Fine Hall</a> where I share a cup of coffee with the greatest minds of this generation discussing very useless, yet beautiful things. I enjoy doing research that might lead some to ask, "when am I ever going to use this?" In college, I have found a way to channel my learnings to the real world through <b>Quant Finance</b> and <b>AGI research</b>. 

Most of my life I was commited to become a professional <a href="https://images.app.goo.gl/YTUvCLMKQM1kAypf6">Go player in Korea like my dad</a>. Now, I play Go whenever I can with my friends at Princeton. I find Go to be an amazing puzzle of math, intuition, and preservation which I hope you try out sometime.

I also love chatting with people. Have you ever wondered what is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun-Yung_Alice_Chang">Alice Chang</a>'s favorite flavor of cake is? (A: It's chocolate cherry!) or what was Grothendieck's perferred method of communication with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nick_Katz">Nick Katz</a>? Well, I'm still trying figure that out.

Now that we are no longer strangers, with any questions or inquiry don't hesitate to reach out via email dk4994@princeton.edu

Sincerely,

Daeun
